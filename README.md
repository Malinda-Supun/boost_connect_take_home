# boost_connect_take_home
A repository for potential candidates to open a PR for their solution.

# Requirements
The objective of the task is to create a JAVA or NodeJS application that will query the dummy API user information and scrape the comments for each user at https://dummyapi.io/explorer. These information’s would need to be stored into a database in a ‘users’ table with proper domain model and is kept up to date whenever the user comment changes (assuming it is possible the comment changes). 

# To send your submission please create a new branch out of main at this repository with this format `<NAME>_Q1`, e.x: JOHN_Q1 , and then open a pull request to main branch. If you encounter any issues, you may contact me directly at hazrid.azad@myboost.co

# Notes
1.	Use the correct data structure to store the user’s information and comments
2.	Apply proper design pattern and SOLID principles during implementation.
3.	Bonus point for utilizing parallel approach to fetch the user’s data, example: fork join pool.
4.	Bonus point for implementing a way to avoid persisting unchanged user data.
